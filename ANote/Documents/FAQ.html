<p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><a name="1"></a>I chose not to create a user, 
  but now I want to create one. How do I do that?</font></p>

<blockquote>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Go to Options -&gt; database and check the 
    box that says 'Download the notes when the program starts ...' Then exit A 
    Note and restart the program and you will be able to create a user.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana"><a name="2"></a>Why won't A Note close when Windows does?</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">When Windows closes it sends a message 
    to all programs that they should close. A Note receives this message and starts 
    to upload the notes to the server. Sometimes the server has a lot of other 
    traffic and therefore is a bit slow to respond to A Note. Therefore, Windows 
    displays the dialog box 'A Note is not responding'. Most of the time, the 
    server will answer A Note, the program will close and so will Windows. If 
    the 'A Note is not responding' time-out<font face="Verdana"> message, </font> 
    you can press 'cancel now'. The notes have already been uploaded and saved 
    to disk.</font></font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana"><a name="3"></a>Can I use Ctrl + B, Ctrl + I, Ctrl + U?</font></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yes, you can.<br>
Ctrl + B will make the selected text or where the cursor are <b>BOLD<br>
</b>Ctrl + I will make the selected text or where the cursor are <i>Italic<br>
</i>Ctrl + U will make the selected text or where the cursor are <u>Underlined</u></font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana"><a name="4"></a>I can't install the newer version over the old version.</font></p>

<blockquote>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Make sure that you have closed A Note before 
    running the installation program. You close A Note by right clicking on the 
    icon and select 'exit'. The installation-program will NOT overwrite any notes 
    that you have saved on disk.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b>: You don't have to uninstall the program before installing the newer 
version. The installation program will do this for you.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana"><a name="5"></a>How do I create a new note?</font></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You can create a new note in two ways:<br>
<br>
1. Right click on A Note's icon and 
select 'New note'<br>
2. Double click on A Note's icon.<br>
<br>
    <b>NOTE</b>: In Options -&gt; General you can set a checkbox for fast creation. 
    Then you will only have to click once on A Note's icon instead of two times.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana"><a name="6"></a>How does A Note Synchronize the notes?</font></p>

<blockquote>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When the program closes, the notes that exists 
    on the computer will be uploaded to a server. When you start the program next 
    time for example on another computer the program will download any note that 
    belongs to the user from the server. If any note already exists on that computer, 
    but doesn't exist on the server, they will be uploaded next time you close 
    the program. In that way you will have the same notes on different computers. 
    i.e your home and your office computer.<br>
<b><br>
    Example</b>: If you have a note on your office computer regarding a party, 
    that note will be uploaded to the server. When you start your home computer 
    the note will be downloaded and you can see the note at home as well. If you 
    alter the note and the changes will be uploaded when you close the program. 
    When you start your office computer, the note on the server will be newer 
    than the one on the office computer and the newer will overwrite the older 
    without any notice.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana"><a name="7"></a>How do I change the title?</font></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You can do this in three different ways.<br>
<br>
    1. The default title can be set in the options. Right click on A Note and 
    select Options and then you can set the title <br>
    2. By double clicking on the title bar on the note you will see a change title 
    dialog.<br>
3. By Right clicking on the note and select 'Change title'</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana"><a name="8"></a>How will I know when a new version is released?</font></p>

<blockquote>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you check the checkbox 'Version check' in 
    the options the program will automatically check for newer versions at every 
    start. If a newer version exists you will be prompted.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana"><a name="9"></a>What should I do with the export / import feature?</font></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you have some notes that you want to share with another user of A Note you 
simply export the notes. The notes will be saved in
an XML-file. You send the xml-file to your pal and he/she imports the notes.<br>
<br>
    <b>NOTE</b>: One single note can NOT be exported, but all of your notes will 
    be exported, so be sure to remove any notes that you don't want to share when 
    exporting to other people.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana"><a name="10"></a>I have found a bug or a feature. How do I report them?</font></p>

<blockquote>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Visit A Note's site <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/a-note/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/a-note/</a> 
    Press Bugs or Feature Requests in the lower area of the site and fill in the 
    bug / feature request. <b><br>
<br>
NOTE</b>: When you have found a bug, please report with as much descriptive text as 
you can.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana"><a name="11"></a>The notes are in the way. How can I "hide" them?</font></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You can "hide" the notes in three different ways.<br>
<br>
1. By right clicking on A Note and deselect 'Stay on top' the notes will appear 
as any normal window i.e. they will not float over any other window<br>
    2. In the options -&gt; Looks you can select 'When minimized show only the 
    title bar'. When you then press the minimize-button (next to the close-button) 
    in the note's upper right corner, the note will not disappear totally, but 
    leave the title bar visible.<br>
    3. By right clicking on A Note and select 'Minimize all', all of the notes 
    will be minimized. And depending how you have set the behaviour in the options 
    -&gt; Looks, they will either show only the title bar or disappear totally. 
    <br>
    You can retrieve any minimized note by either pressing the restore-button 
    on the note or right clicking on A Note and via 'restore' menu-item you can 
    select the note you want to restore. You can naturally move them as any other 
    window by dragging them in the title bar.<br>
<b><br>
    NOTE</b>: A smart way to position the notes is in the lower left corner of 
    the screen. You often don't have much information there. If you have them 
    minimized and only the title bar showing they won't take up much of space. 
    If you have them docked in the bottom area, when pressing restore they will 
    show their contents and when pressing minimize again they will be docked again, 
    so they won't move their position.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana"><a name="12"></a>Can I dock notes to each other?</font></p>

<blockquote>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No, right now you can only dock the notes to 
    the monitor's border.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana"><a name="13"></a>I get 'No contact with server' when the program starts.</font></p>

<blockquote>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It means that the contact to the server couldn't 
    be established. This could either be because you don't have any Internet connection 
    or that the server is temporarily down.<br>
<b><br>
NOTE</b>: The program may not be able to upload or download any notes until this 
error is fixed. The notes will however be saved on disk as normal.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana"><a name="14"></a>I really like this program, How can I help or donate money?</font></p>

<blockquote>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You can help in different ways. If you find 
    a bug, please report it at A Note's web page, If you have a feature request 
    you can also report it at A Note's web page. If you want to donate money you 
    can go to http://a-note.sourceforge.net and click on the donate money image. 
    As I'm making this program on my spare time any donations will be appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks...</font></p>
